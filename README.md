# RLP's Daddy of all Studios

This is a my work-horse Studio that contains 
1. A sandbox singleton for testing schema snippets submitted by users in the community. 
2. A singleton containing examples of the varios custom input components I've shared previously.
3. All of the example Studios that can be generated by the CLI and their associated data

## Usage
1. `git clone` this Studio.
2. Install dependencies w/`npm i` and `sanity install`
3. Import the backup dataset in `/data` by running `sanity import dataset ./data/production/tar/gz <your-dataset-name>`
...
7. Profit!
